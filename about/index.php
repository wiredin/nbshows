<p>The calendar started as an idea to help freinds who don't use facebook hear about shows. We get our show listings from a community supported <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=2auatm870r5a2as9ukgmnp3jq0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York">google calendar</a>.  The google calendar is used to help organize and book shows. It also attempts to prevent clashing by listing local shows in one place.</p>
